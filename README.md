# Digital CV

## Lisa Marie Andersson

This is a website with my digital CV. It contains different pages with a presentation of me, how to contact me, info about my current education within web development, work experience, tech stack, skills etc.
<br>

Under **_Projects_** you can view the most resent projects I've done within web development.
<br>

The website is built with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.
